Notes on the AFsp programs
April 2003

1. The Windows "Send To" menu can be used to select files for InfoAudio or
   CompAudio.  A batch file to invoke, say InfoAudio, can be placed in the
   "Send To" folder in a user's profile.  With that batch file in place, one
   can right-click on an audio file to invoke InfoAudio.
   - The batch file should start up a command window and pass its input
     argument (the file name) to InfoAudio.  The input from InfoAudio will
     then appear in the command window.  Use a PAUSE at the end of the
     batch file to keep the command window on the screen.
   - The file name passed to the batch file is the DOS version of the name.
     A more sophisticated version of the batch file could expand the file
     name before passing it to InfoAudio (for instance by invoking
     "dir <name> /a:-D /x /b").
   - This same strategy can be applied to playing files.  Use CopyAudio to
     copy the selected file to a WAVE file in a temporary directory.  Then
     a standard play routine (for instance, Windows Media Player) can be used
     to play the file.

2. Some external programs assume that WAVE files always have 44 byte headers
   and that the data can be accessed by skipping over the header.  This is not
   in general a safe assumption.
   - The AFsp programs will by default add a trailer containing information
     text.  This trailer can be suppressed if the user explicitly specifies an
     empty information string (-I "").  Other WAVE files (not created by
     the AFsp programs) can also contain trailer information, for instance
     DISP and INFO chunks. 
   - WAVE files specifying more than 2 channels, speaker locations, or a
     number of valid bits which is not the same as the number of bits in
     each sample, will be written as WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE files.
   - The WAVE-NOEX file type can be specified so that the AFsp Programs will
     not use the WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE format.
   - The header lengths for WAVE files are as follows:
       PCM                   44 byte header
       non-PCM               58 byte header (e.g. mu-law data)
       PCM extensible        68 byte header (e.g. 4 channel integer data)
       non-PCM extensible    80 byte header (e.g. 4 channel mu-law data)

3. The AFsp programs can be used as a front end to other programs that do not
   know how to parse certain file headers.  In one scenario, CopyAudio can
   be used to copy the input file to a canonical format (perhaps raw data).
   Alternately, InfoAudio can be used to determine the data type, data
   starting point (header length) and data length.  These value can then be
   passed to a program that can handle raw files with an offset to the data.

4. For Matlab use, CopyAudio can convert data from an input audio file to
   text format.  The output text file can then be imported into Matlab with
   a "load xxx.txt" command.
