<h2>AFprintInfoRecs</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Routine:</h3>
<p>
void AFprintInfoRecs(const AFILE *AFp, FILE *fpinfo)
</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>
Print all information records for an audio file
</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
This formats and prints information records for an audio file. Non-printing
control characters are replaced by a scarab ('\xA4') character. Long lines
are truncated with a trailing ... to indicate truncation.
</p>
<p>
When an input file containing AFsp information records is opened with
AFopnRead, information records are read and stored in the audio file parameter
structure. The following records affect the audio file information that is
stored in the audio file parameter structure or printed when the file is
opened.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>- "date:" or "creation_date:" record</dt>
<dd>
The data and time in that record is printed when the file is opened rather
than the file modification date obtained from the file system.
</dd>
<dt>- "sample_rate:" record</dt>
<dd>
The sample rate in the record is compared to the sample rate from the file
header. If the file header sample rate from the header is an integer value
and agrees with the rounded value of the value in the record, the value from
the record used to set the Sfreq variable in the audio file parameter
structure.
</dd>
<dt>- "loudspeakers:" record</dt>
<dd>
The loudspeaker locations are decoded and the result is stored in the
SpkrConfig array in the audio file parameter structure. The list of speaker
positions is printed when the file is opened, along with the other file
information.
</dd>
<dt>- "name:", "title:", "comment:", or "display_text:" record</dt>
<dd>
This information record printed as "Description: &lt;text&gt;" when the file is
opened.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Information records found in input audio files are returned in the AFInfo
structure which is part of the audio file parameter structure. The
information records are determined from the audio file as follows.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>AU files:</dt>
<dd>
Text information precedes the audio data. If the "AFsp" identifier is
present, the remaining text is stored as information records in the audio
file parameter structure. Otherwise the text is stored as an "info:"
information record.
</dd>
<dt>AIFF and AIFF-C files:</dt>
<dd>
The text information can appear in several different header chunks. This
information is extracted and stored as information records in the audio file
parameter structure.
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
 "NAME" chunk text =&gt; "name:" information record
 "AUTH" chunk text =&gt; "author" information record
 "(c) " chunk text =&gt; "copyright:" information record
 "ANNO" chunk text =&gt; "annotation:" information record
</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
If an "ANNO" chunk text has an "AFsp" tag as a preamble, the remaining text
is stored as individual information records
</dd>
<dt>WAVE files:</dt>
<dd>
Information records are generated from "afsp", "DISP", "LIST", or "bext"
chunks. The information is extracted and stored as information records in
the audio file parameter structure.
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
 "afsp" chunk - Text is extracted and stored as individual information
    records.
 "DISP" chunk - text is stored as a "display_text:" information record.
 "LIST" chunk - INFO text has further subcategories as follows.
   "IARL" text =&gt; "archival_location:" information record.
   "IART" text =&gt; "artist:" information record.
   "ICMS" text =&gt; "commissioned:" information record.
   "ICMT" text =&gt; "comment:" information record.
   "ICOP" text =&gt; "copyright:" information record.
   "ICRD" text =&gt; "creation_date:" information record.
   "IENG" text =&gt; "engineer:" information record.
   "IGNR" text =&gt; "genre:" information record.
   "IKEY" text =&gt; "keywords:" information record.
   "IMED" text =&gt; "medium:" information record.
   "INAM" text =&gt; "name:" information record.
   "IPRD" text =&gt; "product:" information record.
   "ISBJ" text =&gt; "subject:" information record.
   "ISFT" text =&gt; "software:" information record.
   "ISRC" text =&gt; "source:" information record.
   "ISRF" text =&gt; "source_form:" information record.
   "ITCH" text =&gt; "technician:" information record.
 "bext" chunk - information (Broadcast WAVE files) is extracted and
   returned as information records.

<dt>Text audio files (with header):</dt>
<dd>
A "title:" information record is generated from the second line of the
header. Keyword lines in the header generate information records. A
