<h2>CopyAudio</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Routine:</h3>
<p>
CopyAudio [options] AFileA AFileB ... AFileO
</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>
Copy audio files (combine/concatenate, scale and shift data)
</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
This program copies samples from one or more input audio files to an output
audio file. The samples in the output file are linear combinations of the
samples in the different channels in the input files. In the combine mode,
data from multiple input files is combined. In the concatenate mode, data from
multiple input files is concatenated.
</p>
<p>
The output consists of linear combinations of the input data channels. For
instance output channel A can be formed as the average of input channel A and
input channel B. For multichannel data, the data is organized into sample
frames, with samples from individual channels making up a frame.
</p>
<p>
Sample limits may be specified for the input data. The same sample limits
apply to each channel in a file. Sample limits are offset into the file data
and are numbered from zero. Negative sample limits may be specified; the
samples corresponding to negative indices have zero values. Similarly, sample
limits beyond the end-of-file may be specified; samples beyond the end-of-file
are assumed to have zero values.
</p>
<p>
The combine and concatenate modes differ in how they treat multiple input
files. For the combine mode, if there is more than one input file, channels
assignments cross between input files. Consider two input files, with the
first having 3 channels, and the second having 2 channels. The channels are
labelled A to E, with channels A, B and C coming from the first input file and
channels D and E coming from the second input file. For the combine mode, a
single sample limits specification applies to all input files. The default
sample limits correspond to the length of the longest input file. If
necessary, the data from the input files is padded with zeros to a common
length before combining.
</p>
<p>
In the concatenate mode, the data in the input files is concatenated. The
number of channels in each input file must be the same. For the concatenate
mode, sample limits can be specified for each input file. The default sample
limits for an input file correspond to the length of that file.
</p>
<p>
For fixed point file data, the data is normalized to the range -1 to +1. This
normalization becomes important when files with different data formats are
combined.
</p>
<p>
The default data format for the output file is chosen according to a data
format promotion rule based on the data types of the input files. For a single
input file, the output data format will be the same as the input data format
as long as that data format is compatible with the output file type.
</p>
<h3>Options:</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Input file names, AFileI1 [AFileI2 ...]:</dt>
<dd>
The environment variable AUDIOPATH specifies a list of directories to be
searched for the input audio file(s). Specifying "-" as the input file
name indicates that input is from standard input  use the "-t" option to
specify the format of the input data).
</dd>
<dt>Output file name, AFileO:</dt>
<dd>
The last file name is the output file. Specifying "-" as the output file
name indicates that output is to be written to standard output. If the
output file type is not explicitly given (-F option), the extension of
the output file name is used to determine the file type.
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  ".au"   - AU audio file
  ".wav"  - WAVE file
  ".aif"  - AIFF sound file
  ".afc"  - AIFF-C sound file
  ".raw"  - Headerless file (native byte order)
  ".txt"  - Text audio file (with header)
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>-c, --combine</dt>
<dd>
Use the combine mode for multiple input files (default). If no channel
scaling factors are specified, the number of output channels is the sum
of the numbers of channels in the input files.
</dd>
<dt>-C, --concatenate</dt>
<dd>
Use the concatenate mode for multiple input files. If no channel scaling
factors are specified, each output channel is equal to the concatenation
of each channel in each input files.
</dd>
<dt>-g GAIN, --gain=GAIN</dt>
<dd>
A gain factor applied to the data from the input files. This gain applies
to all channels in a file and is applied in addition to the channel
scaling factors. The gain value can be given as a real number (e.g.,
"0.003") or as a ratio (e.g., "1/256"). This option may be given more than
once. Each invocation applies to the input files that follow the option.
</dd>
<dt>-l L:U, --limits=L:U</dt>
<dd>
Sample limits for the input files (numbered from zero). For the combine
mode, the default sample limits correspond to the limits of the longest
input audio file. For the concatenate mode, this option may be given more
than once. Each invocation applies to the input files that follow the
option. The specification "L:" means from sample L to the end; "N" means
from sample 0 to sample N-1.
</dd>
<dt>-t FTYPE, --type=FTYPE</dt>
<dd>
Input audio file type. In the default automatic mode, the input file type
is determined from the file header. For input from a non-random access
file (e.g. a pipe), the input file type can be specified explicitly to
avoid the lookahead needed to read the file header. This option can be
specified more than once. Each invocation applies to the input files that
follow the option. See the description of the environment variable
AF_FILETYPE below for a list of file types.
</dd>
<dt>-P PARMS, --parameters=PARMS</dt>
<dd>
Parameters to be used to specify default parameters for INPUT files. This
option may be given more than once. Each invocation applies to the input
files that follow the option. See the description of the environment
variable AF_INPUTPAR below for the format of the parameter specifications.
</dd>
<dt>-s SFREQ, --srate=SFREQ</dt>
<dd>
Sampling frequency for the output file, default from the input audio
file(s). This option only changes the sampling frequency field in the
output header; the audio data itself is unaffected. The sampling rate can
be expressed as a single value or as a ratio of the form N/D, where each
of N and D can be a floating point value.
</dd>
<dt>-n NSAMPLE, --number-samples=NSAMPLE</dt>
<dd>
Number of samples per channel for the output file. If not specified, the
number of samples is equal to the sum of the numbers of samples in the
input files (concatenate mode) or to the largest number of samples in any
of the input files (combine mode).
</dd>
<dt>-cA GAINS, --cA=CGAINS</dt>
<dd>
The output data for output channel A is created by adding scaled samples
from the specified input channels. For specifying channel scaling factors,
input channels are labelled A, B, ... X, Y, Z. The scaling factor string
CGAINS takes the form
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  [+|-] [gain *] chan +|- [gain *] chan ... +|- offset,
</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
where chan is A through Z. The gains can be expressed as ratios, i.e. of
the form "n/m" or as a real number. The offset is in normalized units,
where an offset of one corresponds to full scale. Note that that the
character "*" is a special character in Unix and should appear only within
single quotes to prevent interpreting it as a wildcard character.
</dd>
<dt>-cB CGAINS, --chanB=CGAINS</dt>
<dd>
Channel scaling  factors for output channel B.
</dd>
<dt>...</dt>
<dt>-cL CGAINS, --chanL=CGAINS</dt>
<dd>
Channel scaling  factors for output channel L.

determined by ranking data types according to precision. The desired
output precision is initially set that of integer16. The desired precision
is compared to the precision of the data in the input files and increased
if necessary. The output data type is determined by a table of available
precisions for the each file type. The table is addressed by the desired
precision.

This program allows direct specification of the gains for 12 output channels
and 26 input channels. The program can handle larger numbers of channels for
the case that the input channels are in a one-to-one correspondence with
the output channels. A gain factor applying to all channels can be specified
with the -g or --gain option.
</p>
<p>
By default, the output file contains standard information records. These are
written to the file header.
