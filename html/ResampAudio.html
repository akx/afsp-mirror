</p>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<p>
Resample data from an audio file
</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
This program resamples data from an audio file.  This process involves
interpolating between the samples in the original file to create a new
sequence of samples with a new spacing (sampling rate).  This program allows
for an arbitrary ratio of output sampling rate to input rate.  The default
settings give a high quality sample rate conversion.
</p>
<h3>Theory of Operation:</h3>
<p>
The process used for interpolation depends on the ratio of the output sampling
rate to the input sampling rate.
</p>
<dl>
<dt> 1: The output/input sampling rate is a ratio of small integers.</dt>
<dd>
The sample rate change process is done using a conventional interpolation
filter designed for the interpolation factor (numerator of the sampling
rate ratio) followed by subsampling by the subsampling factor (denominator
of the sampling rate ratio).
</dd>
<dt> 2: General case.</dt>
<dd>
An interpolating filter is designed using an interpolation factor of 24.
For each output sample, the interpolating filter is used to create two
samples that bracket the desired sampling point.  Linear interpolation is
used between these values to generate the output value.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The default interpolation filter is a linear phase FIR filter designed by
applying a Kaiser window to an ideal lowpass filter response.  The filter is
characterized by a cutoff frequency, a window shape parameter, and the number
of coefficients.  The window shape parameter (alpha) controls the passband
ripple and the stopband attenuation.  For a fixed number of coefficients,
decreasing ripple and increasing attenuation (larger alpha) come at the
expense of a wider transition width.
</p>
<p>
The cutoff of the default interpolation filter depends on the input and output
sampling rates.  Let fsi be the sampling rate of the input signal and fso be
the sampling rate of the output signal.
</p>
<dl>
<dt> 1: fso &gt; fsi.  The cutoff of the interpolation filter is set to fsi/2.</dt>
<dt> 2: fso &lt; fsi.  The cutoff of the interpolation filter is set to fso/2.</dt>
</dl>
<p>
The default design aims for an 80 dB stopband attenuation and a transition
width which is 15% of the cutoff frequency.  The attenuation directly
determines alpha.  The value of alpha together with the transition width
determines the number of filter coefficients.
</p>
<p>
The parameters of the interpolating filter can also be set by the user.  The
design parameters are the interpolation factor, the filter cutoff frequency,
the Kaiser window parameter, and the number of filter coefficients.  The
following table shows the effect of changing the Kaiser window parameter
alpha.
</p>

     80 dB    7.865     5.015    +/- 0.00089 dB  (default)
     90 dB    8.960     5.712    +/- 0.00027 dB
    100 dB   10.056     6.408    +/- 0.00009 dB
</pre>
<p>
The filter transition width parameter is D = (N-1) dF, where N is the number
of filter coefficients and dF is the normalized transition width of the
filter.
</p>
<p>
Consider interpolating from 8 kHz to 44.1 kHz.  The interpolation ratio is
441/80.  For this example we will design the filter for an oversampling ratio
of 10.  This means that the filter will will be operating at a sampling rate
of 80 kHz.  (The default filter for this program would have used an
oversampling ratio of 24.)  The cutoff of the filter will be 4 kHz.  The
stopband attenuation is to be 80 dB.  The attenuation requirement gives
alpha=7.865.  The parameter D corresponding to this value of alpha is 5.015.
A transition width which is 15% of the cutoff corresponds to a width of 600
Hz.  The normalized filter transition width of dF = 600/80000 = 0.0075.
Solving for D = (N-1) dF for the number of coefficients N, gives N = 670.
It is common to choose N to be of the form 2*Ir*M+1, where Ir is the
filter interpolation factor (here 10).  Such a time response has M sidelobes
on either side of the reference point.  In this example, we can choose
M = 34, giving N = 681 coefficients.
</p>
<p>
If we designate the interpolation factor for the interpolation filter as Ir,
about 1/Ir of the coefficients are used to calculate each output sample.
The number of coefficients needed for a given value of alpha and given
transition width is proportional to Ir.  Increasing Ir improves the accuracy
of the linear interpolation step and increases the total number of filter
coefficients, but does not increase the computation effort time for the
filtering operation.
</p>
<p>
For the transition width expressed as a percentage of the cutoff frequency,
the number of coefficients needed to calculate each output sample is
approximately 2D/P where P is the fractional bandwidth (e.g. 0.15 for a
15% transition width).  The number of coefficients (rounded up) used to
calculate each interpolated point is shown in the following table.

</pre>
<p>
On a Windows PC (1 GHz processor), with the default filter (15% transition
width), this program generates about 900,000 output samples per second for
general interpolation and about twice that number for ordinary interpolation.
</p>
<p>
The accuracy of the sample rate operation depends on the frequency content
of the input signal.  Consider increasing the sampling rate for a speech file
with a 8000 Hz sampling rate.  The spectrum of the signal repeats every
8000 Hz.  The default filter uses a cutoff frequency of 4000 Hz with a
transition width of 600 Hz.  The filter passband extends to 3700 Hz and the
stopband starts at 4300 Hz.  The interpolation will be imperfect in that
(1) frequencies falling in the lower part of the transition band will be
attenuated and (2) frequencies falling in the upper part of the transition
band (the image frequencies due to the repetition of the frequency response)
will be only be partially attenuated.  If the input signal has little energy
above 3700 Hz, then the error due to both effects will be small.  Tests
with speech files indicate that the signal-to-distortion ratios after
interpolation (say from 8000 Hz to 8001 Hz) range from 46 to 77 dB.  The
poorest SDR occurs for signals that have significant energy above 3700 Hz.
For a fixed stopband attenuation, the SDR can be improved by increasing the
number of filter coefficients to affect a decrease in the transition band
width.  However, the number of coefficients should not be too large, since
filters with a large time span can introduce pre-echo effects.
</p>
<p>
The interpolation filter can also be read in as a filter file.  For such a
filter, the filter interpolation factor must be specified.
</p>
<p>
The output sample positions are determined by the output sampling rate and
a sample offset parameter.  The sample offset determines the position of the
first output sample relative to the input samples.  The default is that the
first output sample coincides with the first input sample.  The number of
samples in the output file can also be specified.  The default is to make the
time corresponding to the end of the output (rounded to the nearest sample)
be the same as the time corresponding to the end of the input.

<pre>
  Filter file:
    file="file_name"  Input filter file name.  If specified, the filter
                      coefficients are read from the named file.
    ratio=Ir          Filter interpolation factor
    delay=Del         Filter delay in units of filter samples (default
                      for symmetrical filters is (N-1)/2, where N is the
                      number of coefficients).  The delay can be
                      specified as a single number or as a ratio.  The
                      filter delay must be supplied for non-symmetrical
                      filters.
  Windowed lowpass:
   ratio=Ir           Filter interpolation factor.  The default depends
                      on the ratio of output sampling frequency to
                      input sampling frequency.  This parameter can be
                      specified as a single number or as a ratio.
   cutoff=Fc          Filter cutoff in normalized frequency relative to
                      the filter interpolation factor (0 to Ir/2).  This
                      value can be specified as a single number or as a
                      ratio.  The default cutoff frequency is determined
                      from the input and output sampling rates.  For an
                      increase in sampling rate, it is set to 0.5.  For
                      a decrease in sampling rate it is set to
                      0.5*fso/fsi.
   atten=A            Filter stopband attenuation in dB.  The attenuation
                      must be at least 21 dB.  The default is 80.  The
                      attenuation is an alternate way to specify the
                      Kaiser window parameter alpha.
   alpha=a            Kaiser window parameter.  Zero corresponds to a
                      rectangular window (stopband attenuation 21 dB).
                      The default is 7.865 corresponding to a stopband
                      attenuation of 80 dB.
   N=Ncof             Number of filter coefficients.  The default is
                      to choose the number of coefficients to give a
                      transition band which is 15% of the cutoff
                      frequency.
   span=Wspan         Window span.  This is the span of the non-zero part
                      of the window.  The default window span is equal
                      to the number of filter coefficients minus one.
   offset=Woffs       Window offset in units of filter samples.  This
                      is the offset of the first filter sample from
                      the beginning of the window.  The default is a
                      fractional value determined from the fractional
                      part of the input sample offset value.
   gain=g             Passband gain.  The default gain is equal to
                      the filter interpolation factor.  This choice
                      reproduces signals within the passband with the
                      correct amplitude.
   write="file_name"  Output filter file name.  If specified, the filter
                      coefficients are written to the named file.

may be given more than once.  Each invocation applies to the input files
that follow the option.
