Open an audio file for reading
.in -4n
.SH Description
This routine opens an audio file for reading.  The companion routine
AFreadData reads data from the file.  Routine AFclose should be used to
close the file.
.PP
This routine reads the audio file header and optionally prints the header
information.  Several file header formats are supported.  For files with
no header or an unrecognized header, the file format can be declared by
calling routine AFsetNHpar.  A banner identifying the audio file and its
parameters is printed.

.PP
For the fixed point file data representations, read operations return data
values as follows.  The scaling factor shown below is applied to the data in
the file to give an output in the range [-1, +1).

.ti -4n
File type determination:
.br
The default behaviour is to determine the file type from the header of the
input file.  However this requires look-ahead and is not possible with
files that are not random access (for instance a file stream from a pipe).
For both random access and sequential access files, the file type can be
specified explicitly with a call to routine AFsetFileType, obviating the
need to determine the file type from the header.

.ti -4n
Number of samples:
.br
In some types of audio file types, the number of samples is specified in
the file header.  In others, the number of samples is known only if the
file size can be determined, specifically if the file random access.  For
input from a stream which does not allow random access (for instance a file
stream from a pipe), the file size cannot be determined for those files
without that information in the file header.

Notes:
.ti -4n
- Some AU audio files and some ESPS audio files do not specify the number of
samples.
.ti -4n
- AIFF/AIFF-C files with a perverse header cannot be opened for non-random
access.
.in -4n
.PP
On encountering an error, the default behaviour is to print an error message
and halt execution.
