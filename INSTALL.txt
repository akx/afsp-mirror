The AFsp audio file routines are provided free of charge subject to the
simplified BSD license in the file Licence.

Windows Executables:
  Windows versions of the filter design routines (executables) are in the
  MSVC/bin folder.  The MSVC folder can also be used to re-build the Windows
  executables using Microsoft Visual Studio.

Building on Unix Systems:
  After unpacking the sources, run make in the main directory,
    % make
  This will build the library files lib/libtsp.a, lib/libAO.a and the audio
  utility programs in bin/.

Test script:
  Run make in the test directory to run some rudimentary tests on the
  audio utility programs.

Using the library routines:
  To use the AFsp routines in a program you will have to link with the
  object library libtsp.a.  User programs also need access to the header
  file libtsp.h.

Man page files:
  The directory man contains man pages for the utility programs and the top
  level libtsp routines.  These man pages have been automatically generated
  from the corresponding file header and so contain the same information as the
  file header itself.  The extensions for the man pages are .1AFsp and .3tsp.
  On some systems, these will have to be renamed to .1 and .3 in order for the
  man program to recognize them.

html files:
  The directory html contains html files for the utility programs and the top
  level libtsp routines.  These html pages have been automatically generated
  from the corresponding file header and so contain the same information as the
  file header itself.

Other files:
  A number of routines are hidden one level down in a "nucleus" directory.
  These are internal routines used by the AFsp routines and not usually
  directly accessed by a user program.

  The header files in the include/libtsp directory are used to define internal
  data structures.  While not usually used directly by the end user, these
  header files are needed for rebuilding the library.

Mac OS X:
  There have been some problems reported in building the executables. The
  following steps seem to cure the problems.
  1. After building the library libtsp, run ranlib again,
     ranlib lib/libtsp.a
  2. Omit the -s option for the linker,
     make "LDFLAGS=-lm"
